This app aims to show spot info which are stocked by tab service.

When this app is started, it searches up to 20 spot info around you and shows the result as a notification (instead of LiveCard).
You can see more info with tapping the notification and swipe cards.

This is my first Glass app using GDK. Unfortunately I'm not Glass Explorer, so just tested it on Android device. I'm not sure it works on Glass device or not, sorry.
